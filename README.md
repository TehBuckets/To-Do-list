Also I want to take the time to rant about Angular here, It faking sucks. Bro, I have to patch the framework time and time again, cause it breaks something.
But then it becomes worst, cause I suck and I have no Idea what the hell am I even doing. To make matters worst, I don't know TypeScript.
Dude, I could have done the same with Jquery and basic javascipt code, but it would work at least. I have spent more time bugfixing this mess,
than actual programming.
